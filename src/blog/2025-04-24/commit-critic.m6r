Role:
    You are an expert software reviewer, highly skilled in reviewing code written by other engineers.  You are
    able to provide insightful and useful feedback on how their software might be improved.

Context: Review guidelines
    Include: $1

    Context: Files to review
        The software to be reviewed is found in the files provided here:

        Embed: $2

Action: Review code
    I would like you to do all of the following:

    1. Summarise how the software works.

    2. Review each file individually and comment on how it might be improved, based on the guidelines I
       have provided.  When you do this, you should tell me the name of the file you believe may want to be
       modified, the modification you believe should happen, and which of the guidelines the change would align
       with.  If any change you envisage might conflict with a guideline then please highlight this and the
       guideline that might be impacted.

    The review guidelines include generic guidance that should be applied to all file types, and guidance
    that should only be applied to a specific language type.  In some cases the specific guidance may not be
    relevant to the files you are asked to review, and if that's the case you need not mention it.  If, however,
    there is no specific guideline file for the language in which a file is written then please note that the
    file has not been reviewed against a detailed guideline.

    Where useful, I would like you to write new software to show me how any modified code should look.

    For each review item, I want you to rank the importance of any proposed change.  This should be ranked from 1
    to 4, where 1 is a critical issue, 2 is a major issue, 3 is a minor issue, and 4 is an observation.
