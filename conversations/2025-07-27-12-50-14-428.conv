      "content": "The following preamble describes some elements of a language called Metaphor.  Please pay\nextremely close attention to the details as they will affect the way you interpret\neverything that follows after \"BEGIN DESCRIPTION IN METAPHOR:\"\n\nMetaphor is a structured natural language prompt creation language.  It is designed to\nlet a user convey their requirements to a large language model AI.\n\nMetaphor has the structure of a document tree with branches and leaves being prefixed\nby new sections containing the keywords \"Role:\", \"Context:\" or \"Action:\".  Each of\nthese indicates the start of a new block of information.  Blocks are introduced using\nMarkdown-style headings (using hash symbols).  The number of hashes gives an indication\nof the nesting depth and the parent/child relationship.\n\nBlock keywords have an optional name that will immediately follow them on the same line.\nIf this is missing then the block name is not defined.\n\nAfter a block heading there may be one or more lines of text that will describe the purpose\nof that block.  A block may also include one or more optional child blocks inside them and\nthat further clarify their parent block.\n\nWithin the text of a block, you may be presented with code or document fragments inside a\nblock delimited by 3 backticks.  Please pay close attention to the indentation level of the\nopening 3 backticks.  The identation of such code or document fragments is relative to this,\nnot relative to the block in which the code or document fragment occurs.\n\nIf \"Role:\" block exists then this contains details about the role you should fulfil.  This\nmay also describe specific skills you have, knowledge you should apply, and the\napproach you take to apply these.\n\n\"Context:\" blocks provide context necessary to understand what you will be asked to do.\n\n\"Action:\" blocks describes the task, or tasks, you should do.\n\nIf you are asked to offer any opinions on the Metaphor prompt then always provide the full\nset of parent headings leading up to any block you want to talk about.  This will allow\nthe user to understand which part of the Metaphor prompt is being discussed.\n\nWhen you process the actions please carefully ensure you do all of them accurately and\ncomplete all the elements requested.  Unless otherwise instructed, do not include any\nplaceholders in your responses.\n\nBEGIN DESCRIPTION IN METAPHOR:\n\n# Role:\n\nYou are a world-class typescript engineer, highly skilled at building accurate and performant software\n\n# Context:\n\nThis mindspace is for my blog site: davehudson.io\n\nThe source files are in the src directory, and the blog posts are in src/blog.\n\n# Action:\n\nI have several blog posts that were written using almost the same blog post structure that I would like\nyou to add to the davehudson.io site.  These posts can be found in the m6r.ai directory.\n\nThe format isn't exactly the same and the davehudson.io site uses dates for the names of blog posts.\n\nI would like you to create new blogs posts for the davehudson.io site, adding the details to the top\nlevel blog page.  I would also like you to update src/sitemap.xml.\n\nFor each new blog post, you can move any supporting files you require from the m6r.ai directory as that\nis not part of the davehudson.io site.\n\nI would also like you to create/amend any makefiles.\n\nBefore you do this I'd like to see a plan.",

      "content": "Now I have enough information to create a comprehensive plan. Let me create the plan based on my analysis:\n\n## Migration Plan: Moving m6r.ai Blog Posts to davehudson.io\n\nBased on my analysis of both the davehudson.io and m6r.ai blog structures, here's a comprehensive plan for migrating the blog posts:\n\n### **Blog Posts to Migrate (8 posts)**\n\n1. **000003-Introducing-Metaphor** \u2192 **2024-11-01**\n   - Title: \"Introducing Metaphor: An AI-First software development language\"\n   - Supporting files: `metaphor-whiteboard.webp`\n\n2. **000004-Code-reviews-using-Metaphor** \u2192 **2024-11-06**\n   - Title: \"Code reviews using Metaphor\"\n   - Supporting files: `snapshot.webp`\n\n3. **000005-commit-critic** \u2192 **2024-11-15**\n   - Title: \"commit-critic: An AI-powered, AI-built code review tool\"\n   - Supporting files: `commit-critic.m6r`, `sample-guideline.m6r`, `commit_critic.py`, `chatgpt-output.webp`\n\n4. **000008-Vibe-coding** \u2192 **2025-03-20**\n   - Title: \"Vibe coding\"\n   - No supporting files\n\n5. **000009-Initial-thoughts-on-Google-Gemini-25** \u2192 **2025-03-28**\n   - Title: \"Initial thoughts on Google Gemini 2.5\"\n   - Supporting files: `gemini.webp`\n\n6. **000010-The-importance-of-context-in-AI-assisted-coding** \u2192 **2025-04-04**\n   - Title: \"The importance of context in AI-assisted coding\"\n   - Supporting files: `context.webp`\n\n7. **000011-Introducing-Metaphor-commands** \u2192 **2025-04-24**\n   - Title: \"Introducing Metaphor commands\"\n   - Supporting files: `commit-critic.m6r`, `introspection.m6r`, `introspection-screenshot.webp`\n\n8. **000012-Writing-tests-with-Metaphor** \u2192 **2025-06-01**\n   - Title: \"Writing tests with Metaphor\"\n   - No supporting files\n\n### **Key Structural Differences to Address**\n\n1. **BlogPost Class Changes:**\n   - m6r.ai: `BlogPost(title, author, dateTime, hRef, description, imageURL, articleFunction)`\n   - davehudson.io: `BlogPost(title, dateTime, hRef, description, imageURL, preScriptFunction, openingFunction, articleFunction, postScriptFunction)`\n   - Need to: Remove `author`, add `preScriptFunction`, split content into `openingFunction` and `articleFunction`, add `postScriptFunction`\n\n2. **Content Structure:**\n   - m6r.ai posts have single `articleFunction()` with all content\n   - davehudson.io posts separate opening/introduction from main article content\n   - Need to split content appropriately\n\n3. **Navigation and Styling:**\n   - Remove m6r.ai specific navigation calls (`navigateEvent` with m6r.ai paths)\n   - Update to use davehudson.io navigation patterns\n   - Remove m6r.ai specific styling classes\n\n### **Migration Steps**\n\n#### **Phase 1: Directory and File Creation**\n1. Create new date-based directories in `src/blog/` for each post\n2. Copy supporting files (images, code files) to appropriate directories\n3. Create `Makefile.mk` files for each new blog directory\n\n#### **Phase 2: Content Transformation**\n1. Transform each `post.ts` file:\n   - Update BlogPost constructor parameters\n   - Split `articleFunction` into `openingFunction` and `articleFunction`\n   - Add `preScriptFunction` and `postScriptFunction` (set to null initially)\n   - Update image paths from `/blog/000xxx-` to `/blog/YYYY-MM-DD/`\n   - Remove author references\n   - Update any internal navigation links\n\n#### **Phase 3: Integration**\n1. Update `src/blog/blog.ts`:\n   - Add imports for all new blog posts\n   - Add entries to `blogContent` array in chronological order\n2. Update `src/blog/Makefile.mk`:\n   - Add include statements for new blog directory Makefiles\n3. Update `src/sitemap.xml`:\n   - Add entries for all new blog post URLs\n\n#### **Phase 4: Build System Updates**\n1. Create individual `Makefile.mk` files for each blog post directory\n2. Update any build dependencies for new file types (.m6r files, etc.)\n\n#### **Phase 5: Testing and Validation**\n1. Verify all posts render correctly\n2. Check that all images and supporting files load properly\n3. Validate sitemap.xml syntax\n4. Test build process\n5. Verify navigation between posts works correctly\n\n### **Specific Technical Considerations**\n\n1. **Image Path Updates**: All image references need to change from `/blog/000xxx-title/image.webp` to `/blog/YYYY-MM-DD/image.webp`\n\n2. **Code File Handling**: Posts 000005 and 000011 have dynamic code loading that will need path updates\n\n3. **Date Format**: Ensure all dates follow the YYYY-MM-DD format used by davehudson.io\n\n4. **Content Splitting Strategy**: \n   - First 1-3 paragraphs typically go in `openingFunction`\n   - Main sections go in `articleFunction`\n   - Related articles/references can go in `postScriptFunction` if needed\n\n5. **Cross-References**: Update any internal links between blog posts to use davehudson.io paths\n\n### **Files to Modify**\n- `src/blog/blog.ts` (add imports and entries)\n- `src/blog/Makefile.mk` (add includes)\n- `src/sitemap.xml` (add URLs)\n- Create 8 new directories under `src/blog/`\n- Create 8 new `post.ts` files\n- Create 8 new `Makefile.mk` files\n- Copy and organize supporting files\n\nThis plan will successfully migrate all the m6r.ai blog posts to the davehudson.io site while maintaining the existing structure and ensuring all functionality continues to work properly.",
