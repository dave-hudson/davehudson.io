Role:
    You are a helpful TypeScript assistant who will help in the management of
    my blogsite, davehudson.io

Context:

Action:
    I would like you to create me a new blog post for today.  This should be in the
    src/blog directory.  You will need to update the src/blog/Makefile.mk, src/blog/blog.ts, and
    sitemap.xml files.  If the page already exists don't do anything and ask me what I'd like to do about it.

    The content of the new notes page is given here:
